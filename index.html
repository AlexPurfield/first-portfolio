        <p>My name is Alex Purfield and this is my first portfolio. I was born November 20, 1994 and I have three older brothers. We all live in Denver, Colorado as well as my parents. We all live relatively close to East Colfax, which is where spend most of our time. Whether it is at my parents' house that is an old church converted into two units, having a drink at St. Paul's Tavern, or seeing a live punk show at the Bluebird Theater. I think I will remember these days as some of the best. I'm also changing my direction by doing a coding bootcamp to finally pursue a career that I have always been excited about. I'm not the best with the design side of things but believe that I will get better at that the more I learn. I'm very excited to learn about the backend part of coding as that is something I know nothing about as of now. This is my first attempt at a portfolio.</p>
