# Alex Purfield -portfolio


# Expectations 
My name is Alex Purfield and this is my first portfolio using css and html. For this assignment we were asked to make a portfolio using what we have learned about advanced css and html. The requirements for this assignment include having a name and current picture, a navigation bar which takes the user to the corresponding section of the website, a section with click-able pictures representing our apps (the links are only placeholders as we have not made any apps...yet), and a contact section. This is also supposed to adjust to the users screen according to the device they are using.

# My Portfolio
For my portfolio, I started with a wireframe I made with excalidraw, moved on to the html outline and then started on the css styling. The most difficult part was absolutely the flex boxes for the "work" section. I am happy with how the media, and links came out as well as the color palette.
